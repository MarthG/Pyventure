The 'version' variable was named the same as the function that displays it.
'printVersion' makes more sense as a function name as it doesn't return the function,
but simply shows it to the user.

The 'a' variable isn't descriptive (you won't know what it's for in 3 days) - and it's seemingly identical to
'currentState', which makes more sense than 'a'

I also forgot to commit the removal of brackets, I do the same thing a lot, Python does ignore them, but
none of the other statements have it.

While testing I noticed my re-formatting commit had broken the '-v' output (https://awo.oooooooooooooo.ooo/i/4vsk.png)
to mitigate this i've created a new function that uses 3 single line strings.

However, I'm not sure why there's two blank lines surrounding the version, so i've also included a version that removes them,
but left it commented out.

In this commit I removed 'pass' from your functions, it is used as a placeholder for a function that has no code, yours do 
and as nothing calling them is expecting a return of data, there's no need for the placeholder.

Pass will also skip and code after it, and as there is none, it doesn't need to be there.

I've also included a 'argparse' branch, I understand you wanted to use bitwise for your arguments, but yaknow, why reinvent the wheel :D
